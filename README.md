# Mission Control Frontend 🚀  
**Capstone Project – Self-Landing Amateur Rocket System**  

This repository contains the **frontend software** for a Mission Control system developed as part of a senior Capstone project. The full project involved designing and implementing a custom microcontroller board for amateur rocketry, with the goal of enabling **gas-propellant, self-landing rockets**.  

The Mission Control frontend is built in **Python** and provides real-time monitoring, control, and data recording functionality. It interfaces with onboard avionics to help operators observe telemetry, issue stop/abort commands, and log flight data for both **live operations** and **training simulations**.

## 🎯 Project Overview

### Key Objectives
- Collaborate with a mechanical engineering team to develop a low-cost, modular telemetry and control system for rockets.  
- Build custom hardware (microcontroller-based avionics board) to control gas-propellant systems for soft landings.  
- Create a **Mission Control frontend** that enables:
  - Real-time rocket telemetry monitoring
  - Manual system stop/abort controls
  - Flight data recording for post-flight analysis
  - Training-mode simulation playback

---

## 🖥️ Features (Frontend)
- **Live Telemetry Visualization**: View real-time data from rocket sensors (altitude, velocity, orientation, etc.).  
- **Control Interface**: Send stop/abort commands to ensure safety during testing and launches.  
- **Data Recording**: Log flight data for debugging, engineering analysis, and training.  
- **Simulation/Training Mode**: Replay recorded missions for operator training.  
- **Python-based GUI**: Built for simplicity and portability.
